# 🎓 GitHub Wall of Fame – MLSA Session

Welcome to the **GitHub Wall of Fame**, a creative initiative built as part of an interactive session I conducted as a **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (Beta)**.

## 🚀 Why I Created This Project

As an **MLSA Beta**, I hosted a hands-on session to help students understand the fundamentals of **Git** and **GitHub**, focusing on version control, collaboration, and contributing to open source.

To make the session more engaging and impactful, I created this GitHub Wall of Fame where participants could:

- Make their **first pull request**
- Add their **name, college, and a short quote**
- See their contribution live on a web page 🎉

This gave students real experience with GitHub workflows in a fun and memorable way.

## 🧠 What Participants Learned

- Creating a GitHub account
- Forking repositories
- Cloning and editing files
- Committing and pushing changes
- Creating pull requests
- Seeing their changes live on a deployed site

## 💫 My Role

- Organized and conducted the session as a **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (Beta)**
- Built this project to act as both a demo and a live collaborative activity
- Reviewed PRs and helped students through their first GitHub contribution
